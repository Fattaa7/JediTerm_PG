With this info you can program the current sink (CS) accordingly,\n(CS can be programmed by applying appropriate DAC value)\nOld method: by usingModule 05 - Failure Simulation Bus & Sensor Supply\nIn fact Module 5 was kept on Rev. 3.8 only for compatibility with older versions. \nIt's not recommend using it anymore.\nIn fact Module 5 was kept on Rev. 3.8 only for compatibility with older versions. \nIt's not recommend using it anymore.\nComment *1 on page 13 straightens out, that an external current limitation \n(resistor) is required when S_V_12V_IN is shorted to KL31 by operating K0500 (and \nalso for S_H_12V_IN & K0501). Without this current limitation there are two options \nthat could happen:If the current limitation of the DUT PS is very high, the PIP will\nbe damaged. The wire will burn down, and there will be no connection anymore.If the \ncurrent limitation of the DUT PS is  low, the voltage will drop down. Maybe the ECU \nwill be reseted.\nComment *1 on page 13 straightens out, that an external current limitation \n(resistor) is required when S_V_12V_IN is shorted to KL31 by operating K0500 (and \nalso for S_H_12V_IN & K0501).
