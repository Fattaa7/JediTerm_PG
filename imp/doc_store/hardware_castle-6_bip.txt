It can support all \nautomotive buses (CAN, FR, LIN, SPE ETH).\nCASTLE 6 BASE can mount 2 BIPs in the same PIMs.\nIt's divided into 2 connectors:\nLow Speed Communication (CAN HS, CAN LS, LIN, FR)\nLow Speed Communication (CAN HS, CAN LS, LIN, FR)\nEthernet CommunicationAverageEthernet Communication (ETH 10/100/100 \nMb/s)Multigigabit EthernetCommunication (ETH 2.5/5/10 Gb/s)\nEthernet Communication\nAverageEthernet Communication (ETH 10/100/100 Mb/s)\nAverageEthernet Communication (ETH 10/100/100 Mb/s)\nMultigigabit EthernetCommunication (ETH 2.5/5/10 Gb/s)\nMultigigabit EthernetCommunication (ETH 2.5/5/10 Gb/s)\nLow Speed Communication:\nWe support 4 Generic Interfaces which can configured with the communication \ninterface based on project needs.\nGeneric Port 1 ==> Can be configured to be (CAN HS or FR or LIN)\nGeneric Port 2 ==> Can be configured to be (CAN HS or FR or LIN)\nGeneric Port 3 ==> Can be configured to be (CAN HS or CAN LS or LIN)\nGeneric Port 4 ==> Can be configured to be (CAN HS or CAN LS or LIN)\nPIN Mapping:\nPIN_1: DUT_CAN1_H/BP1/LIN1\nPIN_2: DUT_CAN0_H/BP0/LIN0\nPIN_3: DUT_CAN1_L/BM1\nPIN_4: DUT_CAN0_L/BM0\nPIN_5: GND\nPIN_7: DUT_CAN3_H/LIN3\nPIN_8: DUT_CAN2_H/LIN2\nPIN_9: DUT_CAN3_L\nPIN_10: DUT_CAN2_L\nEthernetCommunication:\nAll 4 Ethernet channels are supported throughix connector.\nPIN_1: PHY_1000T_MDI1_P\nPIN_2: PHY_1000T_MDI1_N\nPIN_3: GND\nPIN_4: PHY_100T_MDI2_P\nPIN_5: PHY_100T_MDI2_N\nPIN_6: PHY_1000T_MDI0_P\nPIN_7: PHY_1000T_MDI0_N\nPIN_8: GND\nPIN_9: PHY_10G_MDI3_P\nPIN_10: PHY_10G_MDI3_N\nCustom cables needed for each project to adapt it's need.\nAverage Ethernet Communication\nAlthough we support 3 ethernet interfaces, User can use only 1 channel at a time, \nbecause all 3 ethernet channels are multiplexed into the same switch.\nSwitch Port 1 ==> Can be configured to be (100BASE-T1 or 1000BASE-T1)\nSwitch Port 2 ==> Can be configured to be (100BASE-T1 or 1000BASE-T1)\nSwitch Port 3 ==> Can be configured to be (10BASE-T1S or 100BASE-T1)\nEthernet Cable Connections (Switch Port 1 and Switch Port 3)\nFor Prototyping, We can useAEcable ix/D-SUB9and twisted cable from the D-SUB9 to the\nECU.\nFor Endurance Usage, Custom Cable is needed based on Project Ethernet Interface.\nEthernet Cable Connections (Switch Port 2)\nCustom Cable is mandatory and you need to request it from CASTLE HW Team.\nMultigigabit Ethernet Communication\nWe support only 1 Multigigabit Ethernet channel to support 2.5/5/10 GBASE-T1.\nEthernet Cable Connections\nCustom Cables are mandatory, Prototyping workarounds are not accepted for this high \nspeed interfaces.\nCurrently, We support only ix toYamaichi Y-CircCable. It's equivalent toVector \nAEcable MultiGig (Yamaichi YCP-BPR09ACX-S1MSCDX-041B) Cable.\nIt's main usage is to bring-up CASTLE 6 BIP Multigigabit Ethernet Feature.\nVector Support in Multigigabit Ethernet\nVector supports Multigigabit in 2 Vector Boxes (VN5650 and VN5240) which should be \nequipped withVNmodules60 2AE10G BCM89890\nReferences\nVector Ethernet Cables\nVector Ethernet Modules for VN5650/VN5240", "type": "Document"}}
