Sometimes it takes up to 1 - 2 min until they get \nout of this loop. If they have leaved the loop they behave completely normal and \nreliable. They connect to the CTE and test are exetued without any probelms. These \nPIMs are running stable.\nIf those PIMs are finally in ready state, and a new POR is executed, the boot \nprocess will be executed normaly in most cases.\nIndication\nWithin the reset loop the ready LED is flashing with high frequency in intervalls. \nEvery some seconds the reset LED is illuminated red for about 3 sec.\nStatus quo\nAnalysis is still ongoing.\nWorkaround\n- Just wait for some seconds. In most cases the PIM will boot after some loops.\n- Press and hold the reset push button until the ready LED is blinking orange with a\nconstant frequency.", "type": "Document"}}
