SPI command is as shown in \nfigure(2) and described in below table. We are mainly interested with register CTL \n(Output Control Register) where we can write specific values to appear on the output\nports (O0-to-O7).\nFigure(1)\nFigure(2)\nSo to summarize if we need to activate (D+O) and (D-G), we need to write logic '1' \nto ports O1 and O4 this can be done by this SPI command 0xC712, this SPI command is \ndescribed in below table.\nCMD (11) --> Write command\nADDR (111) --> CTL register address\nDATA (00010010) --> write logic '1' to O1 and O4\nUser Guide\nWe have implemented two APIs to configure/remove all mentioned faults, \n(afcConfigureVideoOutputFault and afcRemoveVideoOutputFault). Please take care about\nbelow notes\nNo restriction to make faults on both lines (D+ and D-) at the same time, for \nexample you put D+ short to GND and D- short to VccYou can make only one fault on \nthe same line at once, FW will prevent you from doing this anyway.D+ short to D- \nremoves all other faults, but the FW keeps the latest history.\nNo restriction to make faults on both lines (D+ and D-) at the same time, for \nexample you put D+ short to GND and D- short to Vcc\nNo restriction to make faults on both lines (D+ and D-) at the same time, for \nexample you put D+ short to GND and D- short to Vcc\nYou can make only one fault on the same line at once, FW will prevent you from doing\nthis anyway.\nYou can make only one fault on the same line at once, FW will prevent you from doing\nthis anyway.\nD+ short to D- removes all other faults, but the FW keeps the latest history.\nD+ short to D- removes all other faults, but the FW keeps the latest history.", "type": "Document"}}
