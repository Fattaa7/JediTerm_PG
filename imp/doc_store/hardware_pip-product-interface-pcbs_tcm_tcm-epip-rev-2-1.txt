Seeherefor more \ninformation.\nThe TCM PIP Rev 2.1 was introduced for project TCM Daimler MRA2.\nTCM PIP Rev 2.1 Top\nTCM PIP Rev 2.1 Bottom with EPIP Plug On an Base PCBs\n\"CASTLE-TCM-4\"\nMain features:\n- 18 Channel Lever Simulation with a simultaneous update rate less than 10 \u00b5s.\n-   6 Channel SAS Simulation with a simultaneous update rate less than 10 \u00b5s.\n- 16 Channel SPI- IOs for standard SPI functionality (CS, CLK, MOSI, MISO) working \nup to 12,5 MBit.  Located on the PLug- on board.\n-   4 Channel SPI- \u00ccOs for MIMO functionality (these channels can also be used for \nstandard SPI- IOs) working up to 12,5 MBit.  Located on the PLug- on board.\n- 60 Channel DIO- IOs split into 10 groups. VDD for each group selectable from +3.3V\nup to DUT supply (KL15, KL30).\n- 16 Channel general purpose ADC\n- 12 Channel general purpose DAC\nPatch Level Definition:\nThis PCB contains an 8-channel DIL switch to define the patch level of the PCB:\nLeft switch:         MSB\nRight switch:       LSB\nPosition up:        1  (HIGH)  (Bit 0 or LSB in the picture)\nPosition down:    0  (LOW)  (Bit 1..7 in the picture)\nBits 0..4:             Minor change level; (down compatible within the major change \nlevel)\nBits 5..7:             Mayor change level; (not down compatible)\nE.g:  To set a patch level with major change level = 1 and minor change level = 6 \nthe switchhas to set to:\n0  0  1  |  0  0  1  1  0\nHW revision / Patch level\nPatches:\n#0.1 LS-DAC:   Refer to \"Patch 0.1 LS_DACs.pdf\"\nPrototype PCB forTCM PIP Rev 2.x\nThePrototype board for the TCM PIP can be used to easily connect a DUT.\nFor this purpose the prototype PCB contains a connector interface on the bottom side\nin order to plug it onto the TCM PIP.\nOn the top side the prototype PCB contains plug connectors [pitch = 0.1\" (2.54mm); \nplug = square 0.025\" (0.64 mm) for all IOs of the TCM PIP.\nSo using the prototype PCB, it is quite easy to connect e.g. a DUT which is \nconnected by a bed of nails.\nBottom side of Prototype PCB\nTop side of Prototype PCB", "type": "Document"}}
