Soft Reset (C5)\nPost date: Mar 31, 2021 4:20:43 PM\nDue to WFH scheme that needs working on machines remotely and CI activities, a high \nneed was raised to reset the base board softly in case of FW stuck for any reason \n(connection interrupted, module disconnection, unaligned access, etc.........).In \ncase of the FW stuck for any reason, the base board is considered to be out of \nfunction, so any Java or C or VHDL in the CTE tool will not a reliable \nimplementation in this case.Rack manager tool is found as a reliable tool to develop\nsuch a solution as it is independent of the CTE tool
