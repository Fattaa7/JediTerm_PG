Virtual lans work on layer 2 of network stack (Network layer) so, devices within the same virtual lan can communicate the data directly without routing capabilities, if some socket within specific virtual lan want to send data to other socket in other virtual lan, it need to use layer 3, routing capabilities |  |  |  |  |\n| VlanId | int | uint16 | - | - |\n| Virtual lan id, it can be project specific or defined randomly for testing prupose |  |  |  |  |\n| isIpV6 | boolean | bool | - | - |\n| boolean to specify whether the user will use Ipv6, 'true' value will allow Ipv6 |  |  |  |  |\n| SourceIP | int[] | uint32 | 4 | 4 |\n| source/local ip for castle input example: [192,168,144,11] for ipv4 ipv4 is 4 bytes while ipv6 is 16 bytes Note that: you should consider the subnet that is the destination ip is part of. Although layer 3 of network stack can handle communication between different subnets (by routing the data to default gateway/router), usually with castle project we don't use routers. so for example if the destination ip is 10.144.13.1, you should use source ip in the same subnet (10.144.13.2 for example) |  |  |  |  |\n| SourcePort | int | uint16 | - | - |\n| source/local port for castle input example: 52000, setting port to zero will let the network stack to choose random source port input range: 0 - 65535 Well-Known Ports (0\u20131023), Registered Ports (1024\u201349151), Dynamic or Private Ports (49152\u201365535) |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n---\n\n### Function: Close\n\n**Description:** Description: Purpose: Closes the TCP connection Example: assume the EthernetServerSocket obj is called 'EthernetServerSocket' and the module name is modTS then you can use it as follow: exu.modTS().EthernetServerSocket().afcClose() Dependency: Should be called (when needed) after server accepts successfully established connection\n\n\n---\n\n### Function: SetUserTag\n\n**Description:** Description: The user tag is a u16 value. Set the user tag by changing the bits according to the Mask and Value.\nThe user tag is stored for each object and is copied into each message that is generated by this object.\nIt is up to the user to define the meaning of the user tag. Parameters:\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n| Name | Type | EncodedType | Format |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Mask | int | uint32 | hex |\n| Value | int | uint32 | hex |\n\n\n---\n\n### Function: _Init\n\n**Description:** Description: Purpose: Initialize Ethernet server Socket Example: assume the EthernetServerSocket obj is called 'EthernetServerSocket' and the module name is modTS then you can use it as follow: exu.modTS().EthernetServerSocket().afc_Init(); Dependency: Should be called as the first API in this module (i.e before calling bind API) Note that: Based on the current implementation, if you use only one EthernetServerSocket (castle act as one server with one defined ip and port), then you don't have to call this API but if you want to simulate multiple server by castle so, you created array of EthernetServerSocket objects in config.appl/ then you may need to call this API per each EthernetServerSocket object\n\n\n---\n\n### Message: GeneralMessage\n\n**Description:** Parameters:\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n| Name | Type | EncodedType | Format |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Data | int[] | uint8 | utf8 |\n\n\n---\n\n### Object: EthernetServerSocketConnection\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n| Name | Interface |\n|---|---|\n| EthernetServerSocketConnection | EthernetServerSocketConnection |\n\n\n---", "type": "Document"}}
