Thus to this the CASTLE \ndevelopment is less complex and at the same time more scalable (by using different \nSoM boards). Base RC06.24 is the successorfor RC06.23and contains some bug fixes and\na few enhancements.\nBase RC06.24 with SoM assembled\nBase RC06.24 bottom (w/o DBs)\nBase RC06.24with PCIe connector\nInfo toBase RC06.24:\nGenericInfo toBase R06:", "type": "Document"}}
