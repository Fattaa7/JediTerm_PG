Now you are supposed to link only the Child \nclass into the task tree  as the child class has also all of the methods of the \n\"Parent\"\nThis was changed in order to allow enxtendable standandard library where a certain \nset of functionally might be common for all Technical Product Lines (TPLs)\nwhere another exthensional set of functions is TPL specific and a further one even \nonly project specific", "type": "Document"}}
