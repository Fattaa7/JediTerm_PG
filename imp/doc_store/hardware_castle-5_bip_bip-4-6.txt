So once configured, the error can be \nenabled/disabled very precisely.\nChanges since version 4.5\nReset of the Flexray controllers must be deasserted via IIC. This avoids the flexray\ncontrollers asserting the IRQ line because of power on reset event. Projects without\nflexray do no more need a dummy flexray interrupt handling.\nFlexray 2\u00d7 MFR4310\nIn the schematic see page 12+13. Each of the Flexray controller supports 2 channel. \nThe channels of both controllers are connected to each other by 0-\u03a9 resistors.\nCAN 2 Channels\nin the schematic see page 8+9. The selection of the used transceiver is made by \nassembly choice.\nVoltage Selection\nThe BIP can be mounted on the Castle 4 and Castle 5. Both platforms use different \nvoltages for their IOs.\nMake sure you select the right voltage for the BIP\nCastle 4: 5.0 Volt\nCastle 5: 3.3 Volt\nThe selection is done with a resistor on the bottom side:", "type": "Document"}}
