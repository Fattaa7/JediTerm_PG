(Usually\nused in P4U scenarios):\nBelow is a table for naming conventions and their mapping to PIDs numbers:\nAccording to the mentioned PIDs mapping we can conclude that from the measurement \nsequence, on the LIN bus PIDs for the front sensors will be as follows:\nNoting that:\nThe sensor reports what's requested in theprevious cyclefor every PID.For the \nresponse of dual measurement PIDs, TOFs are filled in the dual measurement layout - \nF1 and F2 values - as mentioned before inthis link.For the response of single \nmeasurement PIDs, TOFs are filled in the normal sequence (From 1 to 10).Same applied\nfor MAG and Width Values.\nThe sensor reports what's requested in theprevious cyclefor every PID.\nThe sensor reports what's requested in theprevious cyclefor every PID.\nFor the response of dual measurement PIDs, TOFs are filled in the dual measurement \nlayout - F1 and F2 values - as mentioned before inthis link.\nFor the response of dual measurement PIDs, TOFs are filled in the dual measurement \nlayout - F1 and F2 values - as mentioned before inthis link.\nFor the response of single measurement PIDs, TOFs are filled in the normal sequence \n(From 1 to 10).\nFor the response of single measurement PIDs, TOFs are filled in the normal sequence \n(From 1 to 10).\nSame applied for MAG and Width Values.\nSame applied for MAG and Width Values.\nMapping the layout of queries to the PIDs in LDF file is as follows:\nFirst Query PIDs: (8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19)\nFirst Query PIDs: (8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19)\nSecond Query PID: (6)\nSecond Query PID: (6)\nThird Query PID: (21)\nThird Query PID: (21)\nFourth Query PID: (22)\nFourth Query PID: (22)", "type": "Document"}}
