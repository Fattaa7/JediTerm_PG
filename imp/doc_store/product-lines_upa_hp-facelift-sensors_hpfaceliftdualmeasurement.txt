In Hp Facelift there are two main types:\nSingle MeasurementA sensor beams in its resonance frequency only.Between adjacent \nsensors, only one can beam at a time and the rest are only listening\nSingle Measurement\nA sensor beams in its resonance frequency only.\nA sensor beams in its resonance frequency only.\nBetween adjacent sensors, only one can beam at a time and the rest are only \nlistening\nBetween adjacent sensors, only one can beam at a time and the rest are only \nlistening\nDual MeasurementA sensor can either beam in the high frequency or the low \nfrequency.Between adjacent sensor, two sensors can beam at the same time with \ndifferent frequencies.\nDual Measurement\nA sensor can either beam in the high frequency or the low frequency.\nA sensor can either beam in the high frequency or the low frequency.\nBetween adjacent sensor, two sensors can beam at the same time with different \nfrequencies.\nBetween adjacent sensor, two sensors can beam at the same time with different \nfrequencies.\nEvery type of measurement is mentioned in the specs with a certain group of LIN PIDs\nas it'll be illustrated in this page.\nSingle Measurement\nSingle measurement works the same way as the old Hp Sensors, with a list of \ndifferent ranges in PIDs:\nDual Measurement\nDual Measurement feature has been introduced in Hp Facelift sensors for the main \npurpose of increasing the speed of ECU scanning. Previously the ECU used to request \ndirect measurement start from one sensor at a time from 2 adjacent sensors; which \nmeans that it wasn't possible before that two adjacent sensors send direct \nmeasurement at the same time.\nIn the new UPAD_Spec (attached) it's mentioned that 4 new PIDs are added to the \nrequirements stating that:\nThe new feature used increases the sensors scanning cycle by letting at one time \nstamp a sensor:\nStarts direct measurement at one frequency (High or Low).Starts indirect measurement\nat the other frequency from its adjacent sensor.\nStarts direct measurement at one frequency (High or Low).\nStarts direct measurement at one frequency (High or Low).\nStarts indirect measurement at the other frequency from its adjacent sensor.\nStarts indirect measurement at the other frequency from its adjacent sensor.\nThe layout for those dual measurement PIDs are as follows:\nHow does the ECU start requesting measurements from sensors ?\nOne more requirement to be provided here from the P2 software is called the \n\"Measurement Sequence\"; it defines at one time stamp what sequence of PIDs will be \nsent for every sensor as in the following example:\nNaming Conventions:\nFrom the mentioned example, one sensor in dual measurement mode reports two things:\nIts readings from the started direct measurement on frequency \"x\" in layout \npositions {Fx_1 --> Fx_5}.\nIts readings from the started direct measurement on frequency \"x\" in layout \npositions {Fx_1 --> Fx_5}.\nReadings from its neighbor sending on the other frequency \"y\"in layout positions \n{Fy_1 --> Fy_5}.\nReadings from its neighbor sending on the other frequency \"y\"in layout positions \n{Fy_1 --> Fy_5}.\nTaking the Rear Bumper as an example:\nSensor ROL gets[D_h]will report:Its direct measurement readings fromhigh frequencyto\nbe filled in the layout positions {F2-1 ==> F2-5}Indirect measurement readings from \n\"RIL - beaming onlow frequency\" to be filled in the layout positions {F1-1 ==> \nF1-5}.Sensor RIL gets[D_l]will report:Its direct measurement readings fromlow \nfrequencyto be filled in the layout positions {F1-1 ==> F1-5}Indirect measurement \nreadings from \"ROL - beaming onhigh frequency\" to be filled in the layout positions \n{F2-1 ==> F2-5}.Sensor RSL gets[I_h]will report:Indirect measurement readings from \n\"ROL - beaming onhigh frequency\" to be filled in the layout positions {F2-1 ==> \nF2_5}.F1 values in that case in PID layout are sent as noise with value (0)Sensor \nRIR gets [I_l] will report:Indirect measurement readings from \"RIL - beaming onlow \nfrequency\" to be filled in the layout positions {F1_1 ==> F1_5}.F2 values in that \ncase in PID layout are sent as noise with value (0)\nSensor ROL gets[D_h]will report:\nSensor ROL gets[D_h]will report:\nIts direct measurement readings fromhigh frequencyto be filled in the layout \npositions {F2-1 ==> F2-5}\nIts direct measurement readings fromhigh frequencyto be filled in the layout \npositions {F2-1 ==> F2-5}\nIndirect measurement readings from \"RIL - beaming onlow frequency\" to be filled in \nthe layout positions {F1-1 ==> F1-5}.\nIndirect measurement readings from \"RIL - beaming onlow frequency\" to be filled in \nthe layout positions {F1-1 ==> F1-5}.\nSensor RIL gets[D_l]will report:\nSensor RIL gets[D_l]will report:\nIts direct measurement readings fromlow frequencyto be filled in the layout \npositions {F1-1 ==> F1-5}\nIts direct measurement readings fromlow frequencyto be filled in the layout \npositions {F1-1 ==> F1-5}\nIndirect measurement readings from \"ROL - beaming onhigh frequency\" to be filled in \nthe layout positions {F2-1 ==> F2-5}.\nIndirect measurement readings from \"ROL - beaming onhigh frequency\" to be filled in \nthe layout positions {F2-1 ==> F2-5}.\nSensor RSL gets[I_h]will report:Indirect measurement readings from \"ROL - beaming \nonhigh frequency\" to be filled in the layout positions {F2-1 ==> F2_5}.\nSensor RSL gets[I_h]will report:\nIndirect measurement readings from \"ROL - beaming onhigh frequency\" to be filled in \nthe layout positions {F2-1 ==> F2_5}.\nIndirect measurement readings from \"ROL - beaming onhigh frequency\" to be filled in \nthe layout positions {F2-1 ==> F2_5}.\nF1 values in that case in PID layout are sent as noise with value (0)\nF1 values in that case in PID layout are sent as noise with value (0)\nSensor RIR gets [I_l] will report:\nSensor RIR gets [I_l] will report:\nIndirect measurement readings from \"RIL - beaming onlow frequency\" to be filled in \nthe layout positions {F1_1 ==> F1_5}.\nIndirect measurement readings from \"RIL - beaming onlow frequency\" to be filled in \nthe layout positions {F1_1 ==> F1_5}.\nF2 values in that case in PID layout are sent as noise with value (0)\nF2 values in that case in PID layout are sent as noise with value (0)\nSo, to sum up, in a Dual AM mode scan, one sensor might report both direct and \nindirect readings in the same cycle.", "type": "Document"}}
