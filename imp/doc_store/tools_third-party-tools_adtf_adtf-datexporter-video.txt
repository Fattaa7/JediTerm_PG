Exporting to .bmp means, there is no \ncompression. Therefor, 100% quality. If you export to VfW AVI Video Sink, you have \nto use a codec for the videos. Now, the quality of the videos strongly depend on the\nselected codec and the settings for this codec. By choosing MSVC, (Microsoft codec, \nfirst delivered with Win95!) you have chosen one of the worst codec available. For \ngood quality, you should use e.g. x264, HUFFYUV or MJPG.\nTo allow ADTF using other codecs, you simply have to install the codecs on your PC \n(personally, I prefere ffdshow, a kind of all-in-one-codec). But of course, if you \nwant to use the videos on other PCs, the have to be able to decode it.\nIn addition, both VfW-Interface and most of the codecs have dependencies regarding \nresolution (e.g. multiple of 8) and bit depth (e.g. MSVC can only 8 and 16 bit \ncolors). The bitmap-format of your stream have to fit this dependencies. To \ntransform the data, you can either use the Image_Transform-Filter or implement a \nfilter on your own (have a look at the demo_image_transform).\nAnother question from my side:\nAnother question from my side:\nAnother question from my side:\nI have two points now:\nA) The first point: Some codecs, that are installed on my machine, are not in the \nDAT Parser codec drop down list:\nI used thelink, to know what codecs are installed on my machine.

A list of tested \ncodecs can be found in the user documentation of the compresssion toolbox Section \n2.2. Let me know which format you want to support, so I may be able to give further \nassistance.\nAdd B): The error messages come from the codecs. Obviously the codec does not \nsupport the pixel format of the stream. When you select a codec this corresponds to \nthe FourCC-code of the codec. You can find an overview here:http://www.fourcc.org.\nLet me know when I should look up more specific information (I would need to search \nfor it, too). With a short snippet of your DAT-File I could try the possibilites \nmyself.\nAfter Wards, I received other response:\nAn additional information. I'm not an expert about video codecs and the internet is \nnot very verbose about this topic, but it seems, ADTF only supports codecs of type \nICM, but not DMO. DMO  stands for \"DirectX Media Object\" \n(https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/windows/desktop/dd375474(v=vs.85).aspx) \nwhich is a pretty old interface as far as I know.\nRegarding the error messages:I agree with my college. Most codecs have limitations \nregarding pixelformat, size and bitdepth (for example, for many codecs, the size \nbust be a multiple of 8, 4 or at least 2). Be sure your stream meets the \nrequirements of the codec you're using. You can use the filter ImageTransform so \nchange the size / type of your stream if necessary.", "type": "Document"}}
