This is against the \nRS232 standard.\nYou can use this to connect to the Toellner power supply, but you need to use a 1:1 \ncable, instead of the standard crossed one.\nNewer racks with 5.2 backplane have this fixed. Here the crossed cable that comes \nwith the Toellner shall be used.\nHow can you check for the backplane revision?\nIf you look into the rack, with the modules removed, you can see the backplane PCB, \nwhich has on the upper edge the part number and the revision.\nIt would be good, if you check all racks in your department once, and make a sticker\non those old ones, that tell about the 1:1 cable needed.", "type": "Document"}}
