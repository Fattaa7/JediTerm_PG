Need to \nbe recorded when testing.\nSo the tsxml is the key. We want to handle it.\nMethod: use translation tool Excel2TsxmlThe first version of the python project for \nthe excel2tsxml had been done.\nPress button 1 to generate the special excel template.\nOr press button Select to use your excel files.\nAt last press button 2 to generate Tsxml files in TestGroup folder.\nResults show:\nEdit excel file to record manual test steps.\nIn order to do SwTestSpec review, we can use this excel to manage. Using \nDoorsImporter to update in DOORs easily.\nAlso this tool need to be maintained inGit.\nMapping between \"Attributes in Doors SwTestSpec\" and \"Tsxml items\":\naTestAction, aTestExpectation...\naTestResult = <Status /> <TestSerieStatus />\nadASIL = <ASIL />\naTester = <Tester />\naTestMethod = <TestMethod />\naTestPriority = <Priority />\nSome unknown issues:\nHow the tsxml works for Doors-Importer?\naTestMachine = map with what item in tsxml?\naTestDate\nsVariants = <Variants /> map with every ID?\naTestType = <TestBench />", "type": "Document"}}
