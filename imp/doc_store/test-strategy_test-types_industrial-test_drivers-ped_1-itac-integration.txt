At most of the Valeo plants the system that is used for \nmanaging the production using this database is theITAC Suite.\nIn case of using Castle in an EOL environment the tracability data is booked by an \nexternal tool named CSVClient to the tracability database. Therefore the Castle \nenvironment is expected to write the captured data in a specific format (.result \nfile) onto the local hard drive. The CsvClient monitors local availability of these \nfiles and books them to theproduction database.Wiriting to the files is supported by\na stardardized Java Library (ItacLib.java) in the \npackage:castle.testenv.stdlib.industrial.ItacLibMeasurements will appear in CTE as \nwell:\nTracebility System can be accessed by usingMES Client(however acces to the \nunderlying system is due to IS reasons restricted to site local machines)\nContact: Markus Metzner(Wemding)\nIn case if only measurement data analysis is needed thenItac Data Analysis Toolcan \nbe usedrather then commercial MES Client, the tool can be pulled from maven in any \ncastle project (see picture on the right side) - however it required Labview 2020 \nand NET4.5. Castle Build Script entry may look like this:comp( 'com.valeo.mes',    \n'itacdataanalysis'  , '1.2.2.+'     , 'exported.mes'  )\nContact: Christian Rosskopf(Wemding)\nITac Data Analysis Toollooks like this:\nThe tool can be as well used to performMeasurement System Analysis (MSA)procedure 3 \nin a fully automated way. Output is comparable toMinitab\nbut with the advantage that the data is direcly pulled from Valeo ITAC servers \n(meaning influnce of human is 100% prevented, as the recording to the database is \nautomated on the EOLT stations as well).\nFor Test and Tools/Equipment engineers (production side):checking the output of the \nMSA is essential to understand if the chosen methodes, proceduresandmeasurement \nsequences are sufficient to meet the goals per SPPC and have a capable measurement \nsystem.\nFor Software & System engineers (RnD side):checking the output of the MSA is \nessential to understand the variances (part to part) that the designed product has \nto be able to handle with its soft- and hardware.Further is can be used to see if  \nthe product meets its design requirments.(large scale statistical data is often only\navailable once the serial production machines are already up and running - interest \non the data should be therfore on RnD side at least as high as on production side)\nSample Contribution Table  (right side) for one SPPC using ANOVA 2D (here for a \nmachine that is 100% automated-> no operator, however multiple parallel testers)\nFurther Reference Information:\nSix Sigma:  https://www.sixsigmablackbelt.de/", "type": "Document"}}
