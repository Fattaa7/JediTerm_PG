On a second console\n(or a second machine), connect to the machine and port being listened on:\n$ nc 127.0.0.1 1234\nThere should now be a connection between the ports.  Anything typed at\nthe second console will be concatenated to the first, and vice-versa.\nAfter the connection has been set up, nc does not really care which side\nis being used as a `server' and which side is being used as a `client'.\nThe connection may be terminated using an EOF (`^D').\nYou can do simple file transfers or a complete stack for a web server.
