Splitting \nbased on time will be discussed here.\nBy following the upcoming simple steps, time splitting can be easily done.1. Open \n\"Measurement Setup\" window and select \"logging file configuration\" option as in the \nsnapshot below.\n2. From the \"Field Codes\" drop down menu, chooseincrement after time\n3. Then a text will be appended to the \"Destination File\" that is in the \nformat{00h00m}. For changing thedurationof each log file, thosevaluescan beedited, \ne.g, for setting log file duration to10 minutes, it should be modified to{00h10m}.", "type": "Document"}}
