Create SSH key pair\n2. Store the secret private key onto your computer(s)\n3. Store public key on your CoreALM profile\nNow, none of the ssh/scp commands should ask for a passphrase again.\n1. Create SSH key pair\nIf you have GIT Bash installed, just open it somewhere and call ssh-keygen.\nIn the comment string, give something useful. It is best practice to put there \neither yourusername@machinenameor yourvaleo email address.\nThe algoed25519(new)shall be used since beginning of 2023(instead of formerly used \nrsa which will eventually not work in future any more)\nWhen asked for a passphrase, leave empty, just type enter.\nWhen asked for a file location, leave empty, just type enter.\nIt will store it into your user profile, e.g. c:/users/username/.ssh/id_rsa\nIf it asks you to overwrite, then you should somehow decide to backup the \nprevious/delete/...?\nid_ed25519 now contains your secret key.

Store the secret private key onto your computer(s)\nIf you have a second computer, you can copy the id_rsa there onto the same location.\nOr generate another key for this machine.\n3. Store public key on your CoreALM profile\nCopy the content of id_ed25519.pub.\nNavigate on CoreAlm to \"My Workspace\" -> My Settings  (if you have multiple keys \nstore each of them in its own row in the authorization tab)\nAdding multiple public ssh keys to a single user:\nRemarks: Best practise when dealing with common users \"p-...\": putting the machine \nname into the key comment.
