For LIN and USV10 sensors there are other \nsolutions available.\nThis PIP was designed tooperate with the Castle 5 base PCB andcan be used to perform\ntests for AK ultrasonic sensors.\nMost important:\nProvide 2 UPITASICs to support up to 24 sensors\nProvide 2 UPITASICs to support up to 24 sensors\nProvide 2 UPITASICs to support up to 24 sensors\nConfiguration:\nThis PIP requires base PCB Rev. 5.\nThis PIP requires base PCB Rev. 5.\nThis PIP requires base PCB Rev. 5.\nNew Features:\nR05.0 is the 1st revision.\nR05.0 is the 1st revision.\nR05.0 is the 1st revision.\nKnown issues:\nResources:", "type": "Document"}}
