This scheme assigns both brightness and color values to each \npixel. In \u2018YUV,\u2019 \u2018Y\u2019 represents the brightness, or \u2018luma\u2019 value, and \u2018UV\u2019 represents\nthe color, or \u2018chroma\u2019 values. In contrast, the values of the RGB encoding scheme \nrepresent the intensities of red, green and blue channels in each pixel.\nEach unique Y, U and V value comprises 8 bits, or one byte, of data. Where \nsupported, Point Grey color camera models allow YUV transmission in 24, 16, and 12 \nbit per pixel (bpp) format.  In 16 and 12 bpp formats, the U and V color values are \nshared between pixels, which frees bandwidth and may increase frame rate. Known as \n\u201cchroma subsampling,\u201d this technique takes into account the human eye\u2019s greater \nsensitivity to variations in brightness than in color.\nPoint Grey cameras support theYUV444, YUV422 and YUV411 data formats.\nYUV444 Data Format\nThe YUV444 data format transmits 24 bits per pixel. Each pixel is assigned unique Y,\nU and V values\u20141 byte for each value, making it the most straightforward format to \nunderstand.\nThe bytes are ordered in the image in the following manner, where Y, U, V represent \na single byte of color or brightness value, and  0, 1, 2\u2026 represent the pixel \nnumbers associated with those values:     U0 Y0 V0 U1 Y1 V1 U2 Y2 V2\u2026\nThis order results in the following data structure for each pixel:\nYUV422 Data Format\nThe YUV422 data format shares U and V values between two pixels. As a result, these \nvalues are transmitted to the PC image buffer only once for every two pixels, \nresulting in an average transmission rate of 16 bits per pixel.\nThe bytes are ordered in the image in the following manner:  U0 Y0 V1 Y1 U2 Y2 V3 Y3\nU4 Y4 V5\u2026\nThis order results in the following data structure for each pixel:\nYUV411 Data Format\nThe YUV411 format shares U and V values between four pixels, resulting in an average\ntransmission rate of 12 bits per pixel.\nThe image bytes are ordered in the following manner:   U0 Y0 Y1 V0 Y2 Y3 U4 Y4 Y5 V4\nY6 Y7\u2026\nThis order results in the following data structure for each pixel:", "type": "Document"}}
