Seeherefor more \ninformation.\nThe TCM PIP Rev 2.0 was introduced for project TCM Daimler BR205MOPF. As this \nversion was developed to overtake Dater functionality it's much more powerful than \nit's predecessor.\nTCM PIP Rev 2.0 Top                                                                 \n        TCM PIP Rev 2.0 Bottom with EPIP Plug On an Base PCBs\nTCM-CASTLE-3\nMain features:\n- 18 Channel Lever Simulation with a simultaneous update rate less than 10 \u00b5s.\n-   6 Channel SAS Simulation with a simultaneous update rate less than 10 \u00b5s.\n- 16 Channel SPI- IOs for standard SPI functionality (CS, CLK, MOSI, MISO) working \nup to 12,5 MBit.  Located on the PLug- on board.\n-   4 Channel SPI- \u00ccOs for MIMO functionality (these channels can also be used for \nstandard SPI- IOs) working up to 12,5 MBit.  Located on the PLug- on board.\n- 60 Channel DIO- IOs split into 10 groups. VDD for each group selectable from +3.3V\nup to DUT supply (KL15, KL30).\n- 16 Channel general purpose ADC\n- 12 Channel general purpose DAC\nKnown issues:\nPatch #1:  Ocillating DACs.
