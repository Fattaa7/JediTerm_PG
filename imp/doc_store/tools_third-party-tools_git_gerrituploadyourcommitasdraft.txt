Now mostly we do it on local machines on different \nbranches for example. We can get rid of this by using Gerrit drafts.\nGerrit draft can fulfill our needs. We can upload our commit as draft commit, it \nwill not add the mandatory reviewers for these files, it will not appear in \nproject's open changes, you can add any reviewer you want and you can append commits\nto your commit. Once the change is finalized from your side you can publish it to \nthe project and then the normal process will continue.\nTo upload a commit as draft follow below snapshot ( Type %draft after branch name )\nIn Gerrit, you can find your change under My/Drafts as per below snapshot\nWhen you are done from the change, you should click on the Publish button in \nprevious snapshot.\nTo change an existing public commit to draft, amend twice (without change-id, then \nadd a new one), then submit to draft and Abandon the published.", "type": "Document"}}
