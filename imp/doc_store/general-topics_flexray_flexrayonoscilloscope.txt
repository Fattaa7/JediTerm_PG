Each frame \nknows which slot it shall take.\nI spied on the Rx line, coming out of the transceiver, in Scala Project, where the \ncycle time is 5 ms.\nAs you can see here is a pattern that is repeated cyclically each 5 ms, each of \nwhich is a complete cycle.\nWhen zooming to one cycle, we can see that it is divided into slots. Each slot may \ncontain a frame\nAs you can see, Each slot may contain a frame, for example, slot 35 is empty, no \nframe is received to CASTLE in this slot. However, slots 36, 37 and 38 each contain \na frame, which is received by CASTLE\nZooming to view a slot, we can see the frame inside it.", "type": "Document"}}
