Quotes\nmust be created by Sales with the support of Ulrich Schneider.\nCAUTION:\nPlease do not communicate internal Castle costs (e.g. of the Castle price list) to \nexternal customers as they are valid only Valeo internal.\nThe following Castle systems can be provided for customers:\nCustomer releases of PIM FW for UPA projects:\n1. Standard one is:                                                                 \n                                                    2_UPA_HIL_flash.hex\n2. There is a specific built for VW with slower baudrate in Castle - PC \ncommunication:            2_UPA_HIL_flash_500kBit.hex\n3. Initially the standard one was:                                                  \n                                              2_UPA_AUDI_HIL_flash.hex\nThis is basically the same as 1. but should be used only if Audi is customer.\n4. For internal use only:                                                           \n                                                    2_UPA_Valeo_VS6_flash.hex\nApproach:\nThe customer will use Castle as a slave for ULS sensor simulation only in full scale\nHIL, which can be controlled by tools like Carmaker, Dspace etc. VS6 is NOT allowed \nto deliver to external customers. Castle is receiving sensor data via PC CAN using a\nspecific dbc (same like used for VS6 <-> Castle coupling). This means that there is \nno need to deliver a project specific firmware or CTE, please refer to the list \ntable above. Exception is USV10 sensors, where the interface is not CAN anymore but \nEthernet,  Valeo Prague delivers a specific dll (like used in Vosstrex) which uses \nOSI (open simulation interface) to couple external tools with Castle.\nIt is not required that customers connect any other ECU I/Os with Castle, just the \nULS sensor related (Signals lines, Sensor PWR, Sensor GND) are needed. For C5 we \nprovide a library (test_bench_lib) which contains functions to initialize Castle for\nsensor simulation. Failure simulation can be triggered via CAN commands.
