It is used to do\nPV (Process validation), DV (Design validation) and series monitoring (RPA).\nFT- Lite is a smaller test setup which is easier to handle. It is mainly used if \ntests are executed in external test laboratories.\nFT- Menu is not only a test setup but a SW application too. It is the high level \napplication to run tests.

This app support script \nbased test execution.\nIn addition to FT-Menu some NI and Castle installations are required.\nOperationg System:\nAs of today 2019-09-25 we install Windows 10 Enterprise 2019 LTSC (Long Term Service\nChannel) on all IPC used for FT- Menu.\nISO files can be accessed \nhere:https://sites.google.com/a/valeo.com/windows-10-pro/iso-files\nInfo to Windows LTSC can be found \nhere:https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/whats-new/ltsc/\nDUT supply:\nThe standard version of FT- Menu is equipped with only one DUT power supply, because\nmany of our products have only a small current consumption. However, we have also \nprojects where the DUTs have such high current consumption, that each DUT requires \nit's own DUT supply. In this case FT- Menu can be upgraded to accommodate multiple \nDUT supplies.\nThe mainly used supply is the T\u00f6llner TOE8950 series. For more information refer to \ntheTOE8950 series site. These devices are fully supported by FT- Menu and are \ncontrolled via RS 232 interface.\nAnother good option for projects with higher power requirements the TDK- Lambda \nGenesys series is a good choice.For more information refer to theTDK- Lambda Geness \nseries site.These devices are fully supported by FT- Menu and are controlled via LAN\ninterface.\nDocuments:\nFT-Viewer Tutorial\nFT-Viewer Tutorial\nFT-Menu Tutorial - How to set up EXU recovery\nFT-Menu Tutorial - How to set up EXU recovery\nBetriebsanleitung FT- Menu V1.2\nBetriebsanleitung FT- Menu V1.2\nInstruction book FT- Menu V1.2\nInstruction book FT- Menu V1.2\nUser guide FT- Menu V5.1 (DokuFTbench)\nUser guide FT- Menu V5.1 (DokuFTbench)", "type": "Document"}}
