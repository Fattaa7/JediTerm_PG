However, \nbefore moving on to the next step (such as adding another matrix), all threads need \nto finish their part ofthe computation. Abarriercan be used to ensure that all \nthreads complete their multiplication tasks before proceeding.\nSupport in java:\nYou can use CyclicBarrier class from 'java.util.concurrent' in java to use Barriers.\ninit CyclcBarrier object as follow\nCyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(n); where 'n' is the number of threads you\nwant to set barrier for.\nthen you can use barrier.await(); to block all threads at some point before they can\ncontinue their execution. The number of threads will block are 'n'. You can then \ncall barrier.await() again to block all threads in another point without needing to \ninitialize or call anything else you will just call await function hence the name \n'Cyclic'\nsynchronization issues:\nsynchronization issues:\n1-race condition:\nexample: two threads incrementing the same shared variable each time, the first \nthread do 1000 increment and the other one do another 1000 increment. The expected \nresult is 2000 but this may not be the case and you get corrupted final result. \nincrementing a variable includes reading it, add one to its value then write back \nthe addition result and one possible scenario is that both threads reading the same \nvalue, incrementing it and write it back to the memory concurrently, in that way the\nvalue will be incremented once because write back made for thesame valuein both \nthreads\n2- Deadlock:\nexample: Thread 1 locks resource A and waits for resource B and thread 2 locks \nresource B and waits for resource A.\n3- Starvation:\nexample: If a thread with higher priority always gets access to a shared resource, a\nlower-priority thread might never get the opportunity to access the resource.", "type": "Document"}}
