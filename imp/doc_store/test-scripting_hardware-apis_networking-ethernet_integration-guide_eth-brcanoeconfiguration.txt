In this wiki we will cover the needed following points to have our \nown configuration from scratch.\nUsed Vector boxes:\nAs the ETh-Br is a one to one phy connection where the master trains the line with \nthe connected slave, the normal execution flow is to connect CASTLE directly to the \nECU without the ability to connect the Vector box in between and dislike what is in \nCAN or FR.\nDue to the illustrated limitation, We can only connect a Vector box with 2 Eth-Br \nphy transceivers as will be shown later in this wiki. But the main idea is to keep \nfollowing the rule of one to one connection.With 2 transceivers Vector box CASTLE \nwill be directly connected to one of the transceivers and the ECU will be directly \nconnected to the other one (we will discuss later how the data is exchanged between \nthe CASTLE and the ECU).\nThis connection scheme will put a limitation on the used Vector boxes since not all \nthe Ethernet Vector boxes contain 2 transceivers. For Example:  VN5610A contains 2 \ntransceivers and can be used in our environment Setup (between CASTLE and ECU), but \nVN76401 contains only 1 transceiver and can only be connected to either CASTLE or \nECU (Only in Debugging CASTLE alone in our team).\nPins Mapping:\nLet's assume that we connect CASTLE to the first transceiver in VN5610A, so we \nshould connect the Plus line from CASTLE SCALA PIP transceiver to the P line of \nVector Box transceiver. And the same for the N line.\nCASTLE Phy Transceiver:\nVector Box Pin Mapping:\nTrace window buffer size :\nConfiguration from scratch:\nPhy link status recording:\nIt is good to know that the .blf format is the only format which saves the Eth-BR \nphy status from the trace Canoe window.\nExport traces to be viewed in Wireshark:\nLinking between C5r and Canoe traces:", "type": "Document"}}
