This means it is \ncapable of operating in two different ultrasonic frequencies at the same time, i.e. \nit can send either in lower (F1) or higher frequency (F2) and capable of receiving \nechoes from lower and higher frequency channels at the same time.\nIt also means that when sensor is performing direct measurement it can also do \nindirect measurement on the other channel. The sensor always provides result of last\nmeasurement with next firing request or capture command. Typical Dual AM measurement\nsteps are as below:\nNow let's have some examples for different sensors and see how Echos are mapped to \nthe LIN bus.\nColor code as below:\nFSL Communication:\nFSL sensor is used indirect Single AMandindirect Dual AMon the higher (F2) channel. \nDifferent execution steps are as below.\nStep n:\nIn this step sensor is fired in direct AM with PID 10 and in response it will \nreceive echoes from previous step.\nIn this step sensor is fired in direct AM with PID 10 and in response it will \nreceive echoes from previous step.\nThe previous step, i.e. n-1) was indirect dual AM on the higher (F2) channel with \nPID 19.\nThe previous step, i.e. n-1) was indirect dual AM on the higher (F2) channel with \nPID 19.\nIn case of dual AM mode always echoes are received on both the channels (i.e. F1 and\nF2).
