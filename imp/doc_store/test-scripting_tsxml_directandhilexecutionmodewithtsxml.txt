Most of the time, they \nwill switch into HIL mode. Pauses are implemented on the PC clock, the test sequence\njust waits. The time is measured from the end of an action until the start of the \nnext action. Additional overhead is added. In direct mode the test sequence can \naccess results from the DUT and react on it. Direct Mode vs. Hil Mode is controlled \nvia Java annotations at class or method level:\nHil Mode\nHIL mode has deterministic timing. Pauses are implemented on the EXU clock, the test\nsequence is pre calculated. The time is measured from the start of an action until \nthe start of the next action. In HIL mode the test sequence cannot access results \nfrom the DUT and react on it directly. In HIL mode, pausing until event or firing \ntasklets may be used to react on DUT. But still it stays a static linear sequence. A\ndirect mode sequence can run a subsequent HIL mode sequence. The other way is not \npossible. Sequences in HIL mode support the parallel execution of other HIL \nsequences.\nTsxml Execution Modes\nNormally, You need to run Tsxml Test-Cases in Hil Mode. In Some Cases, a tester may \nwant to run some \"Direct-mode\" steps in the Test-Case. We can set each action or \nreaction in the test-case as a HIL Mode or Direct Mode.\nHere's a Tsxml Example in Tsxml Viewer (ECU deaktivieren Action):\nHere's a Tsxml Example in Xml Viewer (ECU deaktivieren Action):\nAs You can see here Action 23 is \"ECU deaktivieren\"\nYou can find the implementation of this action in Libraryprj.lib.zFASMainLib\nYou can run each step as Direct or HIl using Java annotation:\n@RunContextDirect or @RunContextHil\nIf no annotation specified for an english, The CTE will search for a annotation of \nthe library.\nCTE Execution Sequence to decide Execution Mode:\nSearch for the English in Java Library Annotation.If no annotation found, Search for\nthe Whole Lib annotation.\nSearch for the English in Java Library Annotation.\nSearch for the English in Java Library Annotation.\nIf no annotation found, Search for the Whole Lib annotation.\nIf no annotation found, Search for the Whole Lib annotation.", "type": "Document"}}
