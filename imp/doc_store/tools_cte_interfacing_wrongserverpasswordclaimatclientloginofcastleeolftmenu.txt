(above \nscreenshot)\n(simply because the CTE server will be still comparing against the old server \npassword because there was nothing forwarded at the start from FTMenue\nError scenario 2:\nCastleEOL claims about a wrong password:\nDetails:\nIn the PN Config xml there is the batch file referenced which is used by CastleEOL \nto launch the CTE.\nOn top to the arguments insiode of this file the CastleEOL.exe forwards also the \nargument server.password with a value generated from a UUID\nOften it was seen that the batch wich was called from CastleEOL.exe was simply \nmissing the %* at the end of the call command -> for the argument which was \nforwarded by the CastleEOL app was not propperly forwarded to the CTE.\nOr there was a fixed password set in one of the batches in the chain.\nIn such case remove the fixed password and ensure the argument are correcly passed \ndown to the CTE.\nHint:\nIf you are unsure you can print the arguments (anywhere in the call chain of the \nbat/cmd files) by using:\n%*>argumentstrial.txt into a txt file and check your expectations", "type": "Document"}}
