Backwards\ncompatibilityis notguaranteed.\nAn increase of the minor number is needed when there is a new feature added, which \nuser or SW might rely on. Backwards compatibilityisguaranteed.\nAll other changes like fixes do only increase the patch version number.\nThis numbering scheme ensures that people and software logic can make compatibility \ndecisions on those information.\nSpecial care is taken about the major number. It is no more an indicator of the \ngeneration of the hardware.\nInstead, this generation name shall go into the hardware name.\nExample:\nE.g. today (25. Sept 2018) the Castle Basis 5.2 exists.\nComponent name is \"Castle Basis\" and version number is 5.2(.0)\nTo change to this versioning scheme means, that also a rename of the component is \nneeded\nFuture:\nComponent name \"Castle 5 Basis\" and an breaking change update will mean a version \n6.0.0. The major version number does no more show the generation name.\nStoring of information with the CTE\nThe CTE provides the Component-Data dialog. It can be used to show and edit the \nvalues from the EEPROM.\nCalibration data values are not shown.\nHW Type Name\nThe HW-Type-Name, is a string with up to 16 characters.\nOnly defined strings shall be used. So SW can verify that the expected component is \nmounted.\nFor some components, here the names are listed.\nBASE-5\nBASE-5\nBIP-4\nBIP-4\nTCM-PIP-2\nTCM-PIP-2\nUPA-PIP-3\nUPA-PIP-3\nSCALA-PIP-2\nSCALA-PIP-2\nTCM-ENV-PIP-5\nTCM-ENV-PIP-5\nUPA-USV10-5\nUPA-USV10-5\nUPA\nUPA\nHUD-PIP-1\nHUD-PIP-1\nHUD-GMSL3\nHUD-GMSL3\nRADAR-PIP-1\nRADAR-PIP-1\nARTEMIS-PIP-966\nARTEMIS-PIP-966\nHW Version\nThis is the 3 digit version number that is fixed for a produced HW, printed onto the\nboard.\nHW Patch\nThis documents the manual patches applied onto the HW.\nSerial number\nThe serial number of the board instance.\nInformation storage\nEach hardware shall have an EEPROM 24LC08BT-I/MS (1KByte) to carry the hardware \ninformation and calibration data.\nUse A2 to be at GND, resulting in the IIC address 0x50..0x53 to be used.\nA0+A1 pins are not used by this device.", "type": "Document"}}
