The cache has to be up to date.\nThe above figure shows that the database cache will be updatedautomatically in the \nbackgroundevery 30 mins. It also shows that you can force the update of the database\ncache  by clicking on the \"Update cache now\" button.\nManual update:\n1) Right click on a set of selected test groups and click \"Update Tickets\"\nAutomatic update:\nSimply If you have enabled the tickets mapping step in the initialization step, \nwhenever you start the execution the IDE will update the CastleScript.tsxml file of \neach test group automatically.", "type": "Document"}}
