It runs the java \ncompiler for the needed builds and it keeps running in background even after the \ngradle build is finished. This makes subsequent builds faster as it will connect to \nthe running daemon instead of invoking it again.\nBy Default the daemon process has an idle timeout of 3 hours. In case you do not \nneed to have running processes in background for lighter PC Memory and you do not \ncare about the build startup delay, you can either eliminate the daemon timeout or \ndisable the daemon itself. This can be done by passing the following configuration \nto the gradle.properties in the user directory:\norg.gradle.daemon.idletimeout=5000 # in milliseconds\norg.gradle.daemon=false # or disable the daemon itself", "type": "Document"}}
