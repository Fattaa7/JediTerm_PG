So in total the pull-up resistors matches the 3K3 Rpull-up of the HPFL \nsensors. We have evaluated that the LIN- interface of the HP sensor (which is \ndesigned for 1K Rpull-up) is working properly with 3K3 also.However this mean: As of\nR03.8.3 the slew rates measured on the sensor bus lines are slower compared to the \nolder revisions.\nFor both HP and HPFL projects, the additional 4K93 pull-up resistors need to be \nactivated.
