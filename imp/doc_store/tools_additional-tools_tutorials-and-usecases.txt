As the correctness of the \npayload data is checked in environmental (X9) - and EOL testing level.\nRemarks: When enabling the Enable Angle Data Synchronization the CASTLE firmware is \nmerging the data blocks received from the RearLeftDUT over its privat bus to an \nangle which is retrieved from a relative angle encoder attached to the CASTLE \nsystem.\nThe angle-synchronized payload data are compared on the other mentioned test levels \nagainst defined acceptance criteria)\n07.06.2015:  Sample use case of C5: Angle Data Synchonization for radar project:\nHow to enable CAN based angle synchonization for radar PL:\n5.5.2015: How to profile a java application:\n1.
