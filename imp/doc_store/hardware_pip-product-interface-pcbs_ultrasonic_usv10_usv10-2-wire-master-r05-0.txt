In addition to the UPIDs there are discrete \ncircuits controlled by FPGA IOs to replace the UPID functionality. This means with a\nproper FPGA implementation the UPIDs can be replaced. This solution could also \nprovide failure simulation on the ECU to sensor communication.\nThis PIP can be used to perform tests for the new Valeo USV10.2 power class 2-wire \nsensor.\nMost important:\nProvide 4 DSI3 buses. As each bus support up to 6 slaves (sensors), the system \nsupports testing of up to 24 sensors.\nProvide 4 DSI3 buses.
