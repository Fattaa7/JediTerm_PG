(Mailthread: \"CDV SW Operations KPIs based Review\" Launch , \nSOR-KPIs\" 28.07.18)\nThe expectation is that the SwPMs have to fill such template:CDV SW Projects KPIs \nTemplate\nThis means for ENG08/SWE6) the tests leads are asked to provide a part of the needed\nnumbers. The quickest way to do this - in tsxml based projects (which are ideally \nusing the generated Requiremetns API) - is to simply forwared the already captured \nnumbers out of the SwTestSummary generated with the Tools BL 74.\nThe mapping of the numbers (into the sheet of the management is as follows):\nNotice that the rows 10 and 11 have been added in the most recent tools version \npacked into Baseline 74. It it needed to understand the way how the SwTestIDE >= \n5.1.1.0 calculates the pass/ fail numbers per Doors Module/Function as the \nRequiremetns mapping (into the TCS) is still not done on Testcase/Expectation level \nbut rather on Test Sub Series Level.\nFind for this purpose the following picture and explanation (click to enlarge):", "type": "Document"}}
