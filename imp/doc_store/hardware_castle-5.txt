It consist of 3 PCBs:\nBase PCB:FPGA board where tests can be executed.

Like the Base PCB this PCB is also used \nfor all PLs.Supported Interfaces:2 LIN channels2 CAN channels (configurable to LS / \nHS)2 FR nodes (to enable communication start up without a DUT connected).PIP(Product\nInterface PCB): The PIP determine for which PL (project) the PIM can be used. there \nare many PIPs at least one for each PL. By changing the PIP, the PIM can be reused \nbetween different PLs. Adapting the PIM to a new PL does mean that a new PIP has to \nbe created.\nBase PCB:FPGA board where tests can be executed.
