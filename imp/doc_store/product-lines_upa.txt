However there are several hardware (HW) \nversions / configurations for UPA projects available. Due to the fact that PIM \nfirmware (FW) is not compatible between different Caste versions, and also the fact \nthat for each project there is only one FW available, follows that each project \nrequires a particular HW version / configuration. The following table gives an \noverview about available configurations.\n*1:  This is the minimum requirement. Newer revisions of the same generation can \nalso be used.\n*2:  UPA PIP R03.6 can be patched to support also HPFL sensors.\nNotes:\nCastle 5 is the preferred platform for all new UPA projects.If the project contains \nHP or HPFL sensors then Castle 5 is the mandatory platform.To figure out which \nplatform is required for an existing project, you might refer to theCastle firmware \nboards. You should be able to find your project either in register \"C5 owners\" or in\n\"C3/4 owners\". Depended on that you have to use C5 or C3 platform respectively.\nCastle 5 is the preferred platform for all new UPA projects.\nCastle 5 is the preferred platform for all new UPA projects.\nIf the project contains HP or HPFL sensors then Castle 5 is the mandatory platform.\nIf the project contains HP or HPFL sensors then Castle 5 is the mandatory platform.\nTo figure out which platform is required for an existing project, you might refer to\ntheCastle firmware boards.
