The steps for doing so from the\nPython client are as follows:\nSend the seed request diagnostic request.\nSend the seed request diagnostic request.\nSwitch to Direct mode (Necessary for catching the seed in the Python environment.)\nSwitch to Direct mode (Necessary for catching the seed in the Python environment.)\nCalculate the key using its corresponding algorithm.\nCalculate the key using its corresponding algorithm.\nAppend the Calculated key to the diagnostic security service request to be sent.\nAppend the Calculated key to the diagnostic security service request to be sent.\nYou can find an example of the above procedures in the snapshot below.\nAs you can see in the snapshot, thesfcGet().getValue()call returns a string that can\nbe easily manipulated and modified.\nNote: As of the time of writing this LL, thesfcGet().getValue()in Python Cre Client \nis bugged and requires to be fixed manually. The fix should be integrated shortly. \nFor fixing the call, just get rid of the float type casting on the return of \nthegetValuecall to look like the below snapshot.\nPros:\nEasierandfasterimplementation of key calculation on Python fordebuggingpurposes.\nEasierandfasterimplementation of key calculation on Python fordebuggingpurposes.\nMore complexkey calculation functions can be used through calculating in direct \nmode.\nMore complexkey calculation functions can be used through calculating in direct \nmode.\nCons:1. thesfcGet().getValue()API can timeout leading to a Python exception that \nneeds to be handled.
