It's portable and can be powered \nfrom a single In-Car power outlet 12VDC. It also has 2x fans at its back.\nNote- Rev.6\nDimensions:to be verified\nPIR- SA\nThe PIR-SA is basically used for aTCM HIL test setup, but for sure it can be used \nfor any test setup that requires just only one PIM slot. It is also first class if \nyou need to do measurements or troubleshooting on any PIM hardware.\nPIR-SA is only available in Rev. 5.\nPIR- SA- Rev. 5 Front                                                           PIR-\nSA- Rev. 5 Rear\nDimensions: 170 x 58 x 190 mm (without connectors)\nTable case\nThe table case is basically used in R&D.

This PIM address \nhas to be unique for each PIM in a test system. This is ensured in a single rack \ntest system, as each slot in a rack has a unique address.\nMulti rack configurations of a test system are supported as well. The backplane \ncontains a jumper to set different rack IDs. Each rack ID have to be unique in a \ntest system.\nIn general all racks are set to rack ID = 1.\nPIM addresses for rack ID = 1:\nCAN identifiers to communicate with the PIMs are derived from the PIM address:\n0x004 Clock frame send by system clock0x010 \"Stay in bootloader\" message, often \ncalled \"Ping\"To send commands to a PIM CAN identifier is 0x100 + PIM addressTo read \ncommand from the PIM CAN identifier is 0x200 + PIM addressCAN identifier for Status \nmessages from the PIM is 0x300 + PIM address0x400 extended CAN status frames0x600 + \n0x700 another TP used in ULS to communicate with VS6\n0x004 Clock frame send by system clock\n0x004 Clock frame send by system clock\n0x010 \"Stay in bootloader\" message, often called \"Ping\"\n0x010 \"Stay in bootloader\" message, often called \"Ping\"\nTo send commands to a PIM CAN identifier is 0x100 + PIM address\nTo send commands to a PIM CAN identifier is 0x100 + PIM address\nTo read command from the PIM CAN identifier is 0x200 + PIM address\nTo read command from the PIM CAN identifier is 0x200 + PIM address\nCAN identifier for Status messages from the PIM is 0x300 + PIM address\nCAN identifier for Status messages from the PIM is 0x300 + PIM address\n0x400 extended CAN status frames\n0x400 extended CAN status frames\n0x600 + 0x700 another TP used in ULS to communicate with VS6\n0x600 + 0x700 another TP used in ULS to communicate with VS6\nTo check CAN communication, it is a good idea to connect a CAN bus monitor (e.g. \nPCAN-View if you are using the PEAK CAN interface) to have a look on the status \nmessages which are sent periodically.\nCASTLE 5: Ethernet Interface to connect to the PIM(s)\nEach PIM derives a PIM address from the slot it is plugged into.

They are called:\n- V_EXT15 / KL15 / Clamp 0   (Ignition)\n- V_EXT30 / KL30 / Clamp 1   (Battery)\n- V_EXT31 / GND\nRack internal supply\nWithin the rack there is a power supply to supply the PIMs with all required \nsupplies.\nOn the rear panel the outputs of this supply are available. They are called:\n- +5V\n- +12V\n- -12V\n- GND\nUse this connectors just only to check the power supply.\nThey are not designed to supply the DUT!", "type": "Document"}}
