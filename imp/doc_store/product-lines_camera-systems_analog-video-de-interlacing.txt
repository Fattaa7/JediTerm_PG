videos are supported in Castle 5 projects, with the help oftvp5150analog \nvideo decoder chip.Tvp5150 decoder converts analog video inputs (NTSC, PAL, ..) into\ndigital format.Represented digital format uses interlacing scheme.Output digital \nVideo frame is divided into odd and even fields.Even fields are transmitted \ntogether, and so are odd fields.Both fields are identified by a video signal output \nfrom the chip (FID : Field ID).Following is a snapshot of De (Data Enable) signal \nalogside with FID.\nAnalog videos are supported in Castle 5 projects, with the help oftvp5150analog

is supposed to differentiate between even and odd fields and \ncombine them in a single recovered frame.Vsync output from the chip works at 60 \nHz.Vsync input to Video in core decides the SOF (Start of Frame) signal issued to \nVDMA.Working on this frame rate allows only for processing half frame (even or \nodd).Applying Vsync to an And gate with FID input cuts Vsync frequency to half (30 \nFPS), allowing for accepting both even and odd fields.\nVideo in HW core is supposed to differentiate between even and odd fields and \ncombine them in a single recovered frame.\nVideo in HW core is
