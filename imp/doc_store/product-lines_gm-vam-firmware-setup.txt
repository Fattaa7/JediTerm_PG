from the test bench side into the ECU.The Wakeup \nseuqnece is to be covered only by the Power over Coax circuitry, no backchannel \nframes are requested to be sent from Castle side.As per the project requirements, \nthe wakeup signal (over coax) is supposed to be high as long as we need to keep the \nECU in the active stateDriving the wake up signal low will result in shutting down \nthe ECU.The
