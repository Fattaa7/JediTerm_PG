I found one file that \nshows in tree view as different.  When I double click to compare them, it shows no \ndifference.  Then when I close that tab and come back to tree view, it shows them as\nthe same.\nWhenever you are going to compare folders in Beyond compare , you will find that by \ndefault a Folder Compare session uses a simple time-stamp/size comparison because it\nis much faster than comparing file contents.When you double-click the files, you \nopen them in our Text Compare, which uses the File Formats to perform a rules-based \ncomparison.\nSo , in order to prevent opening all the files one by one to check for differences ,\nyou can do the following :\nSession|Session Settings|Comparison| enable theCompare Contents,andRules-based \nComparisonoptions.\nthis will do the text compare for all files inside the folders without opening them \n, which will speed up the comparison process.", "type": "Document"}}
