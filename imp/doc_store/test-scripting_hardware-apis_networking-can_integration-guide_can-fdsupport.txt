VIAS has developed a CAN- FD communication\ncontroller (VHDL code), that can be linked to all C5 projects.\nIn additiona BIP (Bus Interface PCB) of at least revision R04.7.3 is required! This \nis given for assemblies of PCB 6e5997_994 R04.7 with a SNo. >= 701.\nFrom this SNo. the TJA1043T (with CAN- FD support up to 5 MBit) is assembled. Older \nSNo. may also contain the TJA1043T. Follow the description below to find out if your\nBIP will support CAN- FD.\nOlder revisions of BIP R04.7.x can be updated.\nHow to check, if your BIP will support CAN- FD:", "type": "Document"}}
