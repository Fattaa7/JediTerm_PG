The main \nbenefit here is to have several project PIMs controlling the multi-channel PPS in \nparallel. Before LXI, there was RS232, where only one PIM/master can control the PPS\nat a time.\nLXI is robust for configuration and control with simple commands; either from a \nweb-page (like a router page) or programmatically.\nMX100QP Quad Output PPS\nThedevicesupports LXI. For getting started please do:\nPress `Menu` bottom, then select `Remote Control Interface` and note the IP Address \n(ex: 169.254.102.65)\nPress `Menu` bottom, then select `Remote Control Interface` and note the IP Address \n(ex: 169.254.102.65)\nOpen your browser and ensure your PC is connected to the PPS, put the IP in the \naddress bar\nOpen your browser and ensure your PC is connected to the PPS, put the IP in the \naddress bar\nFrom the configure tab, please change the device name to \"ID-XXXX\" where XXXX is the\nasset ID number stickered to it. This will make life easier afterwards.\nFrom the configure tab, please change the device name to \"ID-XXXX\" where XXXX is the\nasset ID number stickered to it.

Commands are case sensitive and cannot have \nextra spaces within. The commonly used commands are:\nSets a volt to a channel:V<1-4> <NUMBER>, example: V1 5, V1 5.0\nSets a volt to a channel:V<1-4> <NUMBER>, example: V1 5, V1 5.0\nSet the current limit to a channel:I<1-4> <NUMBER>, example:I10.65\nSet the current limit to a channel:I<1-4> <NUMBER>, example:I10.65\nTurn a channel ON/OFF:OP<1-4> <1/0>\nTurn a channel ON/OFF:OP<1-4> <1/0>\nGet values by:V<1-4>?andI<1-4>?\nGet values by:V<1-4>?andI<1-4>?\nGet Current measurement:I<1-4>O?\nGet Current measurement:I<1-4>O?\nResets all settings:*RST\nResets all settings:*RST\nCommunicating Ports\nPort 80: Is the standard port for http connection. Mx100QP uses Http V1.0 which by \ndefault allows one command per connection. Unfortunately, http \"Keep-alive\" header \noption used to prevent http disconnection is not supported by MX100QP\nPort 80: Is the standard port for http connection.

In contrast, The listening process used by this port doesn't close the \nconnection after each sent command. Note that this port number may change from one \ninstrument to another. You should open the instrument's configuration web page to \nconfirm the listening port number\nPort 9221: This is an optional port used by MX100QP to send commands over a TCP \nconnection.

This is a wireshark dump of a \"V2 3.4\" command, that returns the default\nempty page. Note the command near the end of the request. Spaces are replaced by \n`+`.\n<Full wireshark dump file>\nCurl Command\nWith a bash, you can simply:\ncurl -X POST -d 'pg=ctrl&cmd=V2+3.4&set=Submit'http://id-12368.local/control.cgi\nCurl sends a minimal http header, and it works as expected. Although extra headers \nmay be appended to match the browser, it's not actually needed:\n<Full wireshark Curl dump file>\nFirmware Example\nHTTP is a string payload protocol over TCP. For simple GET/HEAD/POST requests, a \ndeveloper can simply assemble the packet with a string. Check the complete \nexamplehere. After opening a TCP/80 socket of the PPS, the string is sent. The \nresult status is checked only to be =200 (OK).\nEnvironment setup\nPlease do the following to make your system up and running:\nPlease do the following to make your system up and running:\n1- connect your \"LXI\" instrument to PC using an ethernet connection\n2- if you are using \"LXI MX100QP\" power supply, press on \"Menu\" button on the power \nsupply control panel. Otherwise try to reach out your \"Lxi\" device settings\n3- If you are using \"LXI MX100QP\" press on down button (below down arrow symbol on \nthe screen) then find out \"Remote control Interface\" Otherwise try to find out your \nLxi network connection settings\n4- note the IP address read by your device. you may need to save/memorize it.\n5- open your browser (chrome for example)\n6- in the Search box, write the IP address of your lxi device you already get. Now \nyou should see the LXI home page\n7- click on \"Configure\" menu\n8- uncheck/disable \"auto IP\" and \"DHCP\" options to allow setting static IP only. \nNote that if you checked all options (DHCP, auto IP, static), Lxi instrument will \ntry first DHCP to get a dynamic IP address. if failed it will try the other option \n\"auto IP\", if failed it will allocate the default static IP: 192.168.0.100\nIf your network configurations corrupted for any reason you can reset your remote \ninterface configurations by pressing on \"reset LAN\" button on your instrument back \n(in case your instrument supports this option)\n9- Change IP address to any IP address starting by 192.168.144 and you are free to \nchoose the last byte of your IP address to lie between 181 and 254. example of \nallowed IP address: 192.168.144.188. This is ensure your selected IP address in the \nsame Castle subnet\n10- For subnet field in your browser, change it to : 255.255.255.0\n11- Keep the other fields as it is (with no input)\n12- disconnect any ethernet cable form castle's switch (in castle housing) then \nconnect your ethernet cable to the freed port So now your ethernet cable connects \nyour LXI device to the castle switch\nPlease do the following to configure CTE with the new Lxi instruments library:\nPlease do the following to configure CTE with the new Lxi instruments library:\nNote that the Lxi_Instruments interface is part of Generic firmware. make sure your \nconfig folder in your project root folder has generic firmware configurations.\nHead to config/data check for a file named \"P2_Valeo_Generic.c5c\". in case it exist \nthen your project has a generic firmware configurations\n- add Lxi_Instruments java library (if needed) to CteSetup.xml file in the path: \nPrj/data/CteSetup.xml\nit should look like that:\n<Variant ExuType=\"TS\" Variant=\"\">\n<Libraries>\n<Library ClassName=\"prj.lib.Lxi_Instruments\">\n</Library>\n</Libraries>\n</Variant>\n- add the attached java file: Lxi_Instruments.java to prj/src/prj/lib. if lib folder\nis not found create a new one", "type": "Document"}}
