Thus to this the CASTLE \ndevelopment is less complex and at the same time more scalable (by using different \nSoM boards). Base RC06.23 is the first version which is planned to be used for \nprojects and not for FW development only.\nBase RC06.23 with SoM assembled\nBase RC06.23 bottom (w/o DBs)\nBase RC06.23 with PCIe connector\nGeneric Info to Base RC06.23:\nGeneric Info to Base R06:", "type": "Document"}}
