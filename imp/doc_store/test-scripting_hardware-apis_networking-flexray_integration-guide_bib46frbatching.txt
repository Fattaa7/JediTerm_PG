So the FR bus RX path is \nconnected from the transceiver to FPGA(As FR Controller).\nBIP4.6is incompatible with the current FW design because the FR controller is not \nconnected to the FPGA. So the FR bus RX path is not connected from the transceiver \nto FPGA(As Controller)\nWork around solution:\nIs to batch RX path from the transceiver to the FPGA\nAfter batching the BIP should loke like that (Use case from Scala 3_LAS_VwAudi_Q7):", "type": "Document"}}
