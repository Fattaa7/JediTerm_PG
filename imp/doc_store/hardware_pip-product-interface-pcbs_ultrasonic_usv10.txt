The communication \nbetween the sensor and the ECU is based on the DSI3 standard however there are some \nValeo specific extensions so we call it DSI3xc.\nThe DSI3 interface provides a high bandwidth to transfer raw measurements from the \nsensor to the ECU. Based on the data from all sensors, the ECU can detect the \nenvironment more accurately.\nThe DSI3 supports different bus topologies like star or daisy- chain.\nMeanwhile we have these USV10 versions:\nUSV10.1:  Sensors with 3 pin connectors for star topology (each sensor has its own \ndata line to the ECU).\nUSV10.2: Sensors with 4 pin connector for daisy- chain topology (only 2 I/Os on the \nECU per sensor string. Power and data share one line. On the sensor 2 pins are \ninputs the other 2 pins are outputs to the next sensor).\nUSV10.3: Valeo internaal ASIC development to replace the ASICs from OnSemi.\nAvailable Castle test systems:\nUSV10-Slave PIM:Castle PIM which implements a 4- channel USV10 sensor simulation. \nEach channel supports up to 6 sensors. This PIM can be used to test USV10 UPA ECUs.\nUSV10-M3W(USV10 - master 3 wire):Castle PIM which implements2 USV10 ASIC master.Each\nASICsupports up to 12 sensors. This PIM can be used to test USV10.1 sensors.\nUSV10-M2W(USV10 - master 2 wire): Castle PIM which implements 2 USV10 ASIC master. \nEach ASIC supports up to 12 sensors. This PIM can be used to test USV10.2 sensors.", "type": "Document"}}
