If 2 PCs have the same \nIP, Windows will pop-up a message with IP Conflict.\n4- Now, that all PCs and Castle are connected, make sure that no old rack manager is\nrunning.\n(this is first time only after packages update otherwise CTE will not launch)\n5- Launch the project. You should be having the \"[SC Master]\" at the top of the \nlogging view besides the clock status. This means System Clock of CASTLe is \nmastering the time for all connected PCs. If not shown, then revise from step 1. As \nif PC clock is master this means that the rack clock will be controlled (adjusted) \nby different PCs which will lead to inconsistency in system time.\nCurrent Limitations:\nIt's the users responsibility to ensure none of the following cases is occurring at \ntheir test scenarios\nPPS Module is used while another PIM is relying on the common output EXT_KLMultiple \nelectrical faults drawing too much current\nPPS Module is used while another PIM is relying on the common output EXT_KL\nPPS Module is used while another PIM is relying on the common output EXT_KL\nMultiple electrical faults drawing too much current\nMultiple electrical faults drawing too much current", "type": "Document"}}
