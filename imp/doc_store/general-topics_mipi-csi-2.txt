or\nmultiple cameras and the application processor or image signal processor (ISP) in a \nmobile device.CSI offers a choice of two interface protocols: CSI-2 and \nCSI-3.Manufacturers can select the interface based on prevailing marketplace trends \nthat will impact their design, the performance characteristics their product \nrequires, or the complexity and costs of the implementation.CSI-2, available since \n2005, has achieved widespread adoption and is used to interconnect cameras and \napplication processors in virtually every smartphone built today.It is the most \nlogical choice for any design targeting the smartphone market, offering a robust, \nscalable, low-power, high-speed, cost-effective interface that supports a wide range\nof imaging solutions for mobile devices.CSI-2 uses the MIPI D-PHY specification for \nthe data transport PHY and CSI-2\u2019s Camera Control Interface (CCI), compatible with \nI2C, as the control channel.Most smartphones today operate the CSI-2/D-PHY interface\non four or eight data lanes, depending on the product\u2019s performance \nrequirements.CSI-3, MIPI\u2019s next-generation interface, is a preferred option for \ndesigners who are working with new, higher-performance camera technologies and need \na greater total data rate than can be delivered with CSI-2.The CSI-3 interface, \navailable since 2012, is based on the UniPort-M interface.Which is a totally \ndifferent PHY layer than that of CSI-2 (DPHY)It can service high-resolution, \nhigh-megapixel sensors, facilitate high frame rates needed for teleconferencing and \ncamcorder functionality, support applications such as stereo image capture, and, \nwith a high-speed, bi-directional capability, respond quickly to demanding camera \ncontrol requirements.\nThe
