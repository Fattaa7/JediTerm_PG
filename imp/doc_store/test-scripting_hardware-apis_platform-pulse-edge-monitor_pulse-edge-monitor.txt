Below are \nthe key features and functionalities of this IP:\n1.Pulse Monitor Module (Per Input Pin):\nPulse Measurement enable isprovidedby the usertoobserve the pulses & \nperiods:Measures pulse minimum, average, and maximum times.Measures the period \nminimum, average, and maximum times.\nPulse Measurement enable isprovidedby the usertoobserve the pulses & periods:\nMeasures pulse minimum, average, and maximum times.\nMeasures pulse minimum, average, and maximum times.\nMeasures the period minimum, average, and maximum times.\nMeasures the period minimum, average, and maximum times.\n2.Edge Comparison Module (Between Input Pins):\nEdge Detection:Individual Pin ConfigurationActive High or Active Low Specification: \nEach input pin can be specified as active high or active low specified by the \nuser.Detects and captures rising and falling edges of both input signals depending \non Pin Configuration.Measures the time difference between corresponding edges of the\ntwo input signalsand provided it as an output to the user.\nEdge Detection:\nIndividual Pin ConfigurationActive High or Active Low Specification: Each input pin \ncan be specified as active high or active low specified by the user.\nIndividual Pin Configuration\nActive High or Active Low Specification: Each input pin can be specified as active \nhigh or active low specified by the user.\nActive High or Active Low Specification: Each input pin can be specified as active \nhigh or active low specified by the user.\nDetects and captures rising and falling edges of both input signals depending on Pin\nConfiguration.\nDetects and captures rising and falling edges of both input signals depending on Pin\nConfiguration.\nMeasures the time difference between corresponding edges of the two input signalsand\nprovided it as an output to the user.\nMeasures the time difference between corresponding edges of the two input signalsand\nprovided it as an output to the user.\nCastle User Guide\nThe user can configure the core throughseveralAPIs:\nPulseMonitorEnable: Enables the pulse monitorforthe desired pins.Pins can be \nselected from the enum list provided when the API is clicked.When 'enable' is \ncalled, the measuring starts.When 'disable' is called, the measuring stops.When \nre-enabled, all calculations are reset and started measuring again.SetActiveLevel: \nSets the active level for any of the pins for the edge comparison module.Pins can be\nselected from the enum list provided when the API is clicked.The default active \nlevel is active high.EdgeComparisonEnable: Enables the edge comparison module to \ncalculate the difference in duration between the active edge of pin 1 and the active\nedge of pin 2.This feature can be enabled or disabled as needed.\nPulseMonitorEnable: Enables the pulse monitorforthe desired pins.Pins can be \nselected from the enum list provided when the API is clicked.When 'enable' is \ncalled, the measuring starts.When 'disable' is called, the measuring stops.When \nre-enabled, all calculations are reset and started measuring again.\nPulseMonitorEnable: Enables the pulse monitorforthe desired pins.\nPins can be selected from the enum list provided when the API is clicked.\nPins can be selected from the enum list provided when the API is clicked.\nWhen 'enable' is called, the measuring starts.\nWhen 'enable' is called, the measuring starts.\nWhen 'disable' is called, the measuring stops.\nWhen 'disable' is called, the measuring stops.\nWhen re-enabled, all calculations are reset and started measuring again.\nWhen re-enabled, all calculations are reset and started measuring again.\nSetActiveLevel: Sets the active level for any of the pins for the edge comparison \nmodule.Pins can be selected from the enum list provided when the API is clicked.The \ndefault active level is active high.\nSetActiveLevel: Sets the active level for any of the pins for the edge comparison \nmodule.\nPins can be selected from the enum list provided when the API is clicked.\nPins can be selected from the enum list provided when the API is clicked.\nThe default active level is active high.\nThe default active level is active high.\nEdgeComparisonEnable: Enables the edge comparison module to calculate the difference\nin duration between the active edge of pin 1 and the active edge of pin 2.This \nfeature can be enabled or disabled as needed.\nEdgeComparisonEnable: Enables the edge comparison module to calculate the difference\nin duration between the active edge of pin 1 and the active edge of pin 2.\nThis feature can be enabled or disabled as needed.\nThis feature can be enabled or disabled as needed.\nTo retrieve the output, selectitscorresponding object and call the\"Get\" API.\nRegister File:\nFor detailed information about the register file architecture, refer to the Pulse \nEdge Monitor datasheet available atPulse Edge Register File", "type": "Document"}}
