supplied by the ecu - and at some time stamps, either\nthe ECU or the sensor can pull the line down for a specific period of time.\nHaving a closer look on the above picture, we can find 3 main cycles:\nSend Request: (Tx Cycle)T1 is a specific known time ~ 312 usSent by the ECU to tell \nthe sensor to start sendingdirectechos.Delay ~ 100 us and configurableSimulated by \nCASTLE to indicate the time from the request is received until the membrane starts \nvibration.Decay/Attenuation time ~ 3 ms and configurableSimulated by CASTLE to \nindicate the time when false echos are first sent back to the ASIC chip from the \nmembrane vibration, before the real echo comes back from the obstacle.\nSend Request: (Tx Cycle)\nT1 is a specific known time ~ 312 usSent by the ECU to tell the sensor to start \nsendingdirectechos.\nT1 is a specific known time ~ 312 us\nSent by the ECU to tell the sensor to start sendingdirectechos.\nSent by the ECU to tell the sensor to start sendingdirectechos.\nDelay ~ 100 us and configurableSimulated by CASTLE to indicate the time from the \nrequest is received until the membrane starts vibration.\nDelay ~ 100 us and configurable\nSimulated by CASTLE to indicate the time from the request is received until the \nmembrane starts vibration.\nSimulated by CASTLE to indicate the time from the request is received until the \nmembrane starts vibration.\nDecay/Attenuation time ~ 3 ms and configurableSimulated by CASTLE to indicate the \ntime when false echos are first sent back to the ASIC chip from the membrane \nvibration, before the real echo comes back from the obstacle.\nDecay/Attenuation time ~ 3 ms and configurable\nSimulated by CASTLE to indicate the time when false echos are first sent back to the\nASIC chip from the membrane vibration, before the real echo comes back from the \nobstacle.\nSimulated by CASTLE to indicate the time when false echos are first sent back to the\nASIC chip from the membrane vibration, before the real echo comes back from the \nobstacle.\nReceive Request: (Rx Cycle):T2 is a specific known time ~ 624 us.Sent by the ECU to \ntell the sensor to start receivingindirectechos from its neighbor sensors.\nReceive Request: (Rx Cycle):\nT2 is a specific known time ~ 624 us.Sent by the ECU to tell the sensor to start \nreceivingindirectechos from its neighbor sensors.\nT2 is a specific known time ~ 624 us.\nSent by the ECU to tell the sensor to start receivingindirectechos from its neighbor\nsensors.\nSent by the ECU to tell the sensor to start receivingindirectechos from its neighbor\nsensors.\nVerify Cycle: -
