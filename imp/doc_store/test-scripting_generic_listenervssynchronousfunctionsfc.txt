Unlike the \nSynchronous function which blocks till the requested values returns.\nUse case:\nIn HKM_K3 project, the security algorithm was implemented using a diag listener \nwhich cause the CTE to hang sporadically.\nThe code implemented was refactored to use sfc instead of listener, issue \ndisappeared.
